# Tasks achieved

[X] Write a UI that allows the operator to:
    -   [X] have an "nice" overview of all errors, it should show `unresolved`, then `resolved` and then `backlog` errors
    -   [X] see the `text` and `code` of each error
    -   [X] resolve each individual `unresolved` error by clicking an individual button
    -   [X] unresolve each individual `resolved` error (e.g., when an error was set to `resolved` by mistake) by clicking an individual button
    -   [X] move an individual backlog error to the bottom of the `unresolved` list of displayed errors, by clicking an individual button
    -   [X] undo his last action. E.g., if he resolved an unresolved error, an `undo` functionality enables him to move it back into the unresolved list of errors. This should work between all lists for _ only the last_ action of a user
